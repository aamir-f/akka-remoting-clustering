/**
 * We will split an actor A in multiple smaller actors
 	- same type A
 	- potentially multiple instances on the same node
 	- an instance of A = entity, and it has an ID i.e entityId

 * If we want to do this sharding, then 
   --> Every node starts Cluster Sharding for an actor type.
  		- every node starts a special Shard Region actor.
  		- every Shard Region is responsible for a ShardId. 
  		  (it's often the case that a single Shard Region is responsible for multiple ShardIDs)
  		- a special shard coordinator which will starts as a cluster singleton in our cluster,
  		  its responsible for figuring which shardId stays on which nodes, also responsible for
  		  migrating shards between nodes.

 	--> Every message is sent to the Shard Region of the local node.
 	--> the local shard region will map (runs 2 function to identity shardId, entityId) the message to the Shard ID and an Entity ID
 	--> the local shard will ask the Shard Coordinator (singleton) for the destination node for this shardId, entityId	
 	--> once this SR will receive message from SC, it will simply forward the message to the correct node and entity.
 	--> In future, any message with same shardId, will be directly handled by this SR, without asking SC again.
 	--> If entityId doesn't exist, SR will create the one of type A and route message to it.
 	--> The whole intention of this process was for a particular message M to get to an entity(smaller part of bigger actor A I sharded).

 * Other Sharding Magic
   --> Shard rebalancing
   	   - If a shard has too many entities, the entities can be migrated to other nodes.
   	     This is called a hand over process,during this handover process, messages for a shard are buffered in the responsible shard region.
   	   - the state of the entities is not migrated(same as clustersingleton exercise), best, 
   	   		if we are using stateful entities, then better to make them persistent actors  	

 * Shard passivation 	 
 	- if an entity is passive for a while (doesn't receive messages for a while), best to stop it to free its memory.
 	- we won't use context.stop directly to stop, we will use / entity sends Passivate message to its parent ShardRegion,
 	  then ShardRegion stops the entity.
 	  - If the SR receives the new message destined for the same entityId, SR creates new entity for it.	  			

 	 //why not use master/routees logic, why sharding? 
 * Sharding is useful when the entire state of the system is too big for a single actor and/or a single machine, so you split it into shards.	
 * We aren't looking for consistency, but rather distribution of complex logic.  
 *  Cluster sharding is needed when an actor is too big for a single machine.
