-->The akka-cluster module provides a very simple cluster membership service which lays the foundations for all
   higher-level cluster features of Akka.A cluster is made up from collaborating actor systems called member nodes.
   It is important to understand that cluster membership happens at the level of actor systems,not individual actors.
   Nevertheless it can be used to build high-level cluster features which apply to individual actors


//From Daniel
--> Clustering allows to build distributed application
